# C-labouratory-works
A couple of C++ laboratory works i did 3 years ago (smth like february - may 2015) when i was a student for the first year.
All of this works were done in C++ Builder 6, so it may be unworkable/unreadable nowadays. Newertheless i think some people may need them to expand their knowledge in basic C++ algorithms.
1. Approximation - simple example of how should approximation of function works;
2. Bidirectional list - create/delete/expand bidirectional list and its parts;
3. EqationRoots - simple example of how should eqation solving works;
4. Integrals - same as others, but this programs calculates an integral of function;
5. Reverse Polish notation - a bit tough to understand and explain, it's beter to find some information in internet;
6. Stack - create/delete/expand stack and its parts;
7. Tree - create/delete/expand multidirectional list and its parts.

Unfortunetly (or not), all of this programs use Russian language. Some of them may also be made in English, but i hardly remember which ones.
