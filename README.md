# C-labouratory-works
A couple of C laboratory works i did 3 years ago (smth like september 2014 - may 2015) when i was a student for the first year.
All of this works were done in C Builder 6, so it may be unworkable/unreadable nowadays. Newertheless i think some people may need them to expand their knowledge in basic C algorithms.
1. Approximation - simple example of how should approximation of function works;
2. Bidirectional list - create/delete/expand bidirectional list and its parts;
3. EqationRoots - simple example of how should eqation solving works;
4. Integrals - same as others, but this programs calculates an integral of function;
5. Reverse Polish notation - a bit tough to understand and explain, it's beter to find some information in internet;
6. Stack - create/delete/expand stack and its parts;
7. Tree - create/delete/expand multidirectional list and its parts;

8. First semester/lb6TwoDimensionalDynamicalArrays - simple example of TwoDimensionalDynamicalArrays;
   First semester/lb7Strings - strings and some operations with them;
   First semester/lb8FileSystem - a big (when i was a first year student, that was a big =)) project with file system.

Unfortunetly (or not), all of this programs use Russian language. Some of them may also be made in English, but i hardly remember which ones.
I'd want to add some words about code, i posted here. That was a lot time ago, i learned much things, made a coule bigger and better project myself and in team. I can not even comment on these projects because I made them so long ago.

I hope this will help you with your own studies or you will make copies of my projects and try to improve them.
